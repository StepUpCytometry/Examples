## Cytometry in R: Examples

If you are trying to analyze Cytometry data in R, and are currently struggling with your code, we were in your shoes not that long-ago!.  This repository contains some of our contributions back to the broader cytometry community in the form of code and code-explanations (mainly to questions posted on [r/flowcytometry](https://www.reddit.com/r/flowcytometry/) and [Discord](~https://discord.gg/ZmyPYUQr9Q~). We hope this reduces the barriers (and similarly gnashing of teeth, hair-pulling, and cursing outburst directed at your code) that we experienced when first getting started.

If you are looking for additional resources, take a look at our [Cytometry In R](https://stepupcytometry.github.io/) website where we are starting to add walk-through examples for begginers looking to learn Cytometry in R.
