## Cytometry in R: Examples

So you want to analyze Cytometry data in R, and are struggling with your code? We were in your shoes not that long-ago!. 

This repository represents our contribution back to the broader cytometry community in the form of code and code-explanations. 

We hope this reduces the barriers (and similarly gnashing of teeth, hair-pulling, and cursing outburst directed at your code) that we experienced when first getting started.
