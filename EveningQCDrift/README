Sharing some fun weekend data. We wanted to evaluate to what extent the MFI  for individual detectors set by morning QC on the Aurora 5-laser drifted  over the course of the day (to inform whether  evening users should be running QC). Over the last couple months (and inadvertently two bead lots ðŸ˜… ) we acquired 5000 SpectroFlo QC beads before morning qc, after morning qc, before evening qc and after evening QC,  gated the .fcs files for the beads, and extracted the median MFI values for each detector. All things said and done, we surprisingly didn't see much drift in the evening pre-QC MFI compared to the after morning QC MFI for most detectors, with the exception for the blips seen YG2, YG3 and R1 detectors.
